        Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
        Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.

        It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
        Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.
        The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.
        She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

        When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
        Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then

        “Since I was a little girl, I’ve been obsessed with grandiose acts and performers who make the seemingly impossible possible,” Banks said. “I love how AGT brings that feeling into everyone’s home, capturing the best of people who come out and give it their all to make those big, fierce and outrageous dreams come true.”

        When NBC made AGT’s Season 12 renewal last August, the network announced that host Cannon and judges Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, Mel B. and Howie Mandel all would be returning in 2017.

        Cannon recently quit the series via an emotional post last month, in which he announced that he was leaving after allegedly being threatened with termination by NBC over an AGT- and NBC-related racial joke in his new Showtime stand-up special. Cannon emceed the show for 8 seasons.

        Banks hosted and executive produced Top Model for all of its 22 cycles on UPN and the CW. She also hosted her own syndicated talk show, The Tyra Banks Show, and co-hosted FabLife. She continues to executive produce Top Model, which has been revived by VH1.

        AGT is coming off one of its highest-rated seasons in years with the show’s creator/executive producer Simon Cowell as new judge.

        “Welcome to the America’s Got Talent family, Tyra! This is really exciting,” said Cowell.

        NBC’s head of alternative Paul Telegdy added, “Tyra is the complete package: Out-of-this-world talented, funny, brilliant and all heart. In whatever she has done, she has always connected with audiences around the world. Her vivacious spirit will infuse AGT in a big way.”
